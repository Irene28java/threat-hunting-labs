## Detection Opportunities

- Monitor changes to authorized_keys files
- Alert on SSH root logins using key-based authentication
- Correlate sudo escalation followed by SSH configuration changes

## Defensive Gaps
- No default alerting on SSH key persistence
- Requires File Integrity Monitoring or EDR
